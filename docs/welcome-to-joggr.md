# Summary

Hello, welcome to Joggr! ðŸ˜€ We ([Zac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacrosenbauer/) and [Seth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethrosenbauer/)) started Joggr, because we have a love/hate relationship with documentation. We love the benefits but hate the time required to do it well! In short, we built Joggr for people like us, software developers.

**What is Joggr?**

Joggr is an internal knowledge base for software developers. Joggr integrates directly with GitHub and your IDE (COMING SOON) and automatically maintains the documentation for you. We support everything from code documentation to how-to guides and diagrams. If there is a use case we currently do not support, please let us know.

**What is Joggr for?**

Joggr is meant for software developers who are writing **internal** technical documentation. Other documentation platforms like confluence or notion are used by folks in Operations, HR, and more. Our focus is **on software developers** and building for their use cases.

# Getting Started

To onboard and start using Joggr, you only need to complete two steps:

1. Install our GitHub App

2. Sign-Up

To onboard, go to [app.joggr.io](app.joggr.io) and follow the instructions to install our GitHub app and sign up. This should take **\~3-5 minutes**. If you're having any trouble, please reach out to us on your company's Slack channel or email our CEO Seth at <seth@joggr.io>.

Once, you completed the onboarding, check out our video tutorials that will help you get started with importing existing documentation, creating documentation, and organizing documentation on Joggr.

# Video Tutorials

Watch the videos below to learn more about how we use Joggr @ Joggr ðŸ˜€ If you are looking for more help, please reach out to us in your company's slack channel or email Seth directly at <seth@joggr.io>

## How to Import Existing Documentation

Watch the video below to learn how to import existing GitHub markdown into Joggr. When you import GitHub markdown to Joggr, we create a Pull Request. [Here ](https://github.com/joggrdocs/support/pull/1)is an example of what this will look like and why Joggr does this. **Please make sure to merge this pull request**, so that you do not run into merge errors (this would only occur if you leave this pull request open for a long time and there are conflicts).

If you're looking for help importing documents from confluence, notion, Google Drive, or other platforms, please reach out to the Joggr team and we will assist.

## How to organize documentation in Joggr

Watch the video below from our CTO as he walks through how to organize documentation. Getting this right is very important so that developers can easily find what they need without asking others.

If you need help on how to think about this, please reach out to the Joggr team and we can provide examples of what other teams have done. Watch the video below to see an example of how we set up our directory structure.

# Common FAQs

**Can I see an audit history?**

Yes, of course. Joggr is built on top of GitHub. Every JoggrDoc created is committed to GitHub as a markdown file. Therefore, you can manage the audit history just like you do with your codebase ðŸ˜€ [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file) is GitHub's documentation on how to view the history of a file.

**What happens when I move documents in Joggr? GitHub?**

In Joggr, feel free to move documents into any directory that you desire. Moving documents between directories in Joggr will have zero impact on where this is stored in GitHub.

If you move a document (.md) file in GitHub that also exists in Joggr, there will be no issue. However, there is one edge case we currently do not support. If you move a GitHub .md file to another location in GitHub AND rename it at the same time, this will cause the Joggr "link" to the document to break. We use this link to help maintain the document. Please reach out if you have any questions on this edge case.

**What happens when I delete a document? Does it delete in GitHub?**

When you delete a document in Joggr, it only deletes it in Joggr. The document will remain in Github. If you delete a document in GitHub, then the document will be deleted in both GitHub and Joggr.
