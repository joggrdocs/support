# Summary

Hello, welcome to Joggr! ðŸ˜€ We ([Zac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacrosenbauer/) and [Seth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethrosenbauer/)) started Joggr, because we had a love/hate relationship with documentation. We love the benefits but hate the time required to do it well! In short, we built Joggr for people like us, software developers.

**What is Joggr?**

Joggr is an internal knowledge base for software developers. Joggr integrates directly with GitHub and your IDE (COMING SOON), helps you define your documentation process, and automatically maintains the documentation for you. We support everything from code documentation, how-to guides, SOPs, and diagrams. If there is a use case we currently do not support, please let us know.

**What is Joggr for?**

Joggr is meant for software developers. Other documentation platforms like confluence or notion are used by folks in Operations, HR, and more. Our focus is **all on software engineers**. We do have some product managers who use Joggr as well.

# Getting Started

To onboard and start using Joggr, you only need to complete two steps:

1. Install our GitHub App

2. Sign-Up

To onboard, go to [app.joggr.io](app.joggr.io) and follow the instructions to install our GitHub app and sign-up. This should take **\~3-5 minutes**. If you're having any trouble, please reach out to us on your company's Slack channel or email our CEO Seth at <seth@joggr.io>.

Once, you completed the onboarding, check out our video tutorials that will help you get started with importing existing documentation, creating documentation, and organizing documentation on Joggr.

# Common FAQs

**Can I see an audit history?**

*Yes, of course. Joggr is built on top of GitHub. Every JoggrDoc created is committed to GitHub. Therefore, you can manage the audit history just like you do with your codebase *ðŸ˜€* *[*Here*](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file)* is GitHub's documentation on how to view the history of a file.*

**What happens when I move documents in Joggr? GitHub?**

*In Joggr, feel free to move documents into any directory that you desire. Moving documents between directories in Joggr will have zero impact on where this is stored in GitHub.*

*If you move a document (.md) file in GitHub that also exists in Joggr, there will be no issue. However, there is one edge case we currently do not support. If you move a GitHub .md file to another location in GitHub AND rename it at the same time, Joggr will not update our understanding of its location. This could cause things to break.*

**What happens when I delete a document? Does it delete in GitHub?**

*When you delete a document in Joggr, it only deletes it in Joggr. The document will remain in Github. If you delete a document in GitHub, then the document will be deleted in both GitHub and Joggr.*

**How do I add more repositories to Joggr?**
