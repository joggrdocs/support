# Common FAQs

**Can I see an audit history?**

*Yes, of course. Joggr is built on-top of GitHub. Every JoggrDoc created is committed to GitHub. Therefore, you can manage the audit history just like you do with your codebase *ðŸ˜€* *[*Here*](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file)* is GitHub's documentation on how to view the history of a file.*

**What happens when I move documents in Joggr? GitHub?**

*In Joggr, feel free to move documents into any directory that you desire. Moving documents between directories in Joggr will have zero impact on where this is stored in GitHub.*

*If you move a document (.md) file in GitHub that also exists in Joggr, there will be no issue. However, there is one edge case we currently do not support. If you move a GitHub .md file to another location in GitHub AND rename it at the same time, Joggr will not update our understanding of its location. This could cause things to break.*

**What happens when I delete a document? Does it delete in GitHub?**

*When you delete a document in Joggr, it only deletes it in Joggr. The document will remain in Github. If you delete a document in GitHub, then the document will be deleted in both GitHub and Joggr.*

**How do I name a document?**

When creating a document, you name the doc. You are unable to edit the name in Joggr right now, you must go to GitHub.
